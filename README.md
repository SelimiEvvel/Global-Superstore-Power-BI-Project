This dataset consists of 51,290 rows and 24 columns, and it is a hypothetical dataset created for educational purpose. The analyses were conducted under three main headings.

The first page contains reports related to products.
The second page includes analyses related to customers.
The third page shows the breakdown of sales globally by region, country, state, and city.
## Analyses on the Product Page
Initially, six cards were created to provide summary information about sales. The large numbers on the first three cards show the sales of the selected year, while the small numbers and icons below show the previous yearâ€™s sales and the difference in amount and percentage.
